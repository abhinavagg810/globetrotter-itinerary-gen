🌍 **About the Project – Travel Globe AI**
Travel Globe AI is an open, AI-powered travel planning application built to explore how generative AI can simplify and improve real-world trip planning.
The goal of this project is to create a simple, extensible, and collaborative travel planner that helps users generate personalized itineraries, manage trip details, and collaborate with fellow travelers—all in one place.
This repository is open for learning, experimentation, and contributions. Whether you’re interested in frontend development, AI-driven UX, or building consumer-grade products, you’re welcome to explore, fork, and improve the project.
